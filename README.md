## PHP Docker Images

This repository contains Docker images tailored for PHP development. They are optimized for development purposes but can be adapted for production use with a few modifications.

### Maintenance Policy:
We actively maintain images only for PHP versions that are currently supported. Once a PHP version reaches its end-of-life, updates for that version will cease in this repository.

For a list of currently supported PHP versions, refer to the official [PHP Supported Versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).
